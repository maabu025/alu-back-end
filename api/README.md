API Data Handling Project
 Overview

This project demonstrates how to interact with a REST API, gather data, and export it into different formats such as CSV and JSON. It is built in Python and consists of a series of scripts that progressively handle API data in various ways.

The project is useful for learning about:

Consuming REST APIs in Python

Data transformation and export

Working with CSV and JSON files

Organizing API responses into structured formats

Features

Fetch user/task data from an API endpoint

Export data into CSV format
